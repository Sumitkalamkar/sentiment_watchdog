2025-07-21 11:04:15,Agent,"Alright. I've been using this for over 3 months and first things first, I was skeptical of the hinge. It is not a problem. If you rough handle a phone, it is bound to get some cracks and problems here and there and so is the case with this. But, if you handle it with care, you won't face this hinge issue. I haven't. The sound quality is good, camera both front and back are good. Camera is good but samsung could do way better. One thing with the back camera is that, it makes the objects look lively, which is ofcourse a good thing. It is a steal deal at just 60K.",neutral

Now after 2yr its display has corrupted.

Its a very weak quality phone with very very high repairing cost.",sadness
